# Lung Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

## 🌟 Overview

This project provides an automated solution for **lung disease classification** using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a web interface for real-time predictions. It is designed to classify X-ray images into the following categories:

- **COVID-19**
- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**
- **TUBERCULOSIS**

The system consists of:
1. **Deep Learning Model**: Trained on a labeled lung X-ray dataset.
2. **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface for uploading X-ray images and viewing predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: A powerful yet lightweight model for classification.
- **Dataset Management**: Automatically organizes and normalizes train/test/validation data.
- **Early Stopping**: Reduces overfitting with automatic training halts.
- **Real-Time Metrics Visualization**: Plots training and validation accuracy and loss.
- **Interactive Web App**: Powered by Flask, allowing easy image uploads and predictions.
- **Modular Design**: Flexible codebase for extending functionality.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries:
  ```
  TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, Pillow, Matplotlib
  ```

### Dataset Structure
Ensure your dataset has the following structure:
```
Data/
├── train/
│   ├── COVID-19/
│   ├── NORMAL/
│   ├── PNEUMONIA/
│   ├── TUBERCULOSIS/
├── val/
├── test/
```

### Train the Model
1. Place the dataset in the `Data/` directory.
2. Start training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved in the `runs/` folder as `best_weight.h5`.

## 🌐 Using the Web App

1. **Run the Web App**:
   ```bash
   python web_app.py
   ```
2. Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Upload an X-ray image, and the app will display the predicted class.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Enhance the web app with advanced features (e.g., heatmaps for visual explanations).
- Use pretrained models like EfficientNet or ResNet for improved accuracy.
- Include more disease classes in the dataset.
